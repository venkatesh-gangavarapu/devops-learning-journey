# Day-18: Failure Handling & Recovery (Production DevOps)

## Overview
Day-18 focused on understanding how production systems handle failures safely.
The emphasis was on detection, rollback, blast radius reduction, and recovery.

## Failure Types
- Application crashes
- Bad deployments
- Configuration errors
- Infrastructure issues
- Human mistakes

## Detection & Response
- Automated health checks
- CI/CD feedback
- Monitoring alerts

## Rollback Strategy
- Immediate rollback to last known good version
- Health-gated deployments
- Safe failure handling in deployment scripts

## Recovery Process
1. Detect failure
2. Roll back
3. Restore service
4. Investigate root cause
5. Improve safeguards

## Key Learnings
- Failures are inevitable
- Fast recovery matters more than perfection
- Rollbacks must be automated
- Postmortems drive system reliability

## Interview Questions
- Q1: What is rollback and why is it important?
- Q2: How do you detect deployment failures?
- Q3: What is blast radius and how do you reduce it?
- Q4: What should be done first during an outage?
- Q5: Why are postmortems important?
