# Day-11: Git Workflows & Pull Requests for DevOps

## Overview
Day-11 focused on understanding how DevOps engineers collaborate using Git workflows
and Pull Requests to safely deliver changes to production.

The emphasis was on real-world team practices rather than individual Git usage.

## Topics Covered

### GitHub Flow
- main branch as production-ready code
- feature branches for isolated changes
- Pull Requests as the mechanism for change delivery

### Pull Requests (PRs)
- PRs as review and safety checkpoints
- PRs as CI/CD trigger points
- Why PRs protect production environments

### DevOps Code Reviews
- Reviewing infrastructure and configuration changes
- Identifying secrets or unsafe config changes
- Ensuring rollback and deployment safety

### Merge Strategies
- Squash merge for clean history
- Why squash merges are preferred in DevOps teams

## Key Learnings
- DevOps work is collaborative and review-driven
- Pull Requests are essential for production safety
- CI/CD pipelines are tightly integrated with PR workflows
